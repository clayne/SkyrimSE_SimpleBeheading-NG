; Simple Beheading Mod Configuration
; Description: This mod enhances combat in Skyrim by allowing actors to perform decapitations on enemies when striking towards their heads.
; Adjust the settings below to customize the probability and conditions of beheading, as well as the weapon types eligible for this feature.

# Probability of regular attacks beheading actors (from 0.0 to 100.0)
fRegularAttackChances = 35.0

# Probability of power attacks beheading actors (from 0.0 to 100.0)
fPowerAttackChances = 80.0

# Maximum allowed distance between the strike and the actors's head for beheading
fHitPrecision = 25.0

# Whether to play a sound when beheading occurs (1 for yes, 0 for no)

# Whether only the player can behead NPCs (1 for yes, 0 for no)
